Thick Client application or fat client application are those apps which are installed into your machines. They are also known as Desktop Application, which are full-featured and Connected to the network.

While a thick client is fully functional without a network connection, it is only a “client” when it is connected to a server. The server may provide the thick client with programs and files that are not stored on the local machine’s hard drive

### *~~Common Architectures of  Thick Client applications~~*

```note-purple
1. Two-Tier architecture

In two-tier architecture, the thick client application implements a client-to-server communication. The application is installed on the client computer and, in order to work, will need to communicate with a database server.

2. Three-Tier Arhitecture
In three-tier architecture, the client communicates with an application server, which in turn talks to the database in a manner similar to a regular web application. The most common communication method in these applications may be carried out using HTTP/HTTPS.  
Three-tier architecture has a security advantage over two-tier architecture, because it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server.
