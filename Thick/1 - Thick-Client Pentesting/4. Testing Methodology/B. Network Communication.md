Once the Application is installed in OS, it is important to know what kind of traffic is sent by thick client application and application server.
```
```Note-Green
There are basically two kind of network traffics, that can be sent by TC application:
1. TCP traffic
2. HTTP traffic.
```

<mark>Note : - </mark><p><b> Sometimes it is seen that sensitive information is passed betweek TC and application server such as:
<ul>
<li>Sensitive data transferred over an unencrypted tunnel (clear-text credentials/secrets/API Keys etc.)</li>
<li>HTTP and HTTPS web endpoints (Web Services, REST API)</li>
<li>File blobs/chunks sent over the wire</li>
<li> Proprietary protocols used by the program</li>
</ul>

There are basically many ways to intercept the traffic between TC application and application server.:</b>

1. We can use the vanilla method  <mark style="background-color: red">Burpsuite</mark>   for traffic interception. We just need to set the system proxy in order to capture all the request that are being sent from client to server and vice-versa.

2. <b><u>Extras: -</b></u> While performing the testing of UWP (Universal Windows Platform) A.K.A Microsoft Store apps, it may be sometimes tricky to intercept the data.  But Not to Fear, We have another tool called as Fiddler that can help us out in intercepting the traffic between UWP apps and application server.
